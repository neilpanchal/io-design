<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

<p>The overall objective of the proposed TRL-3 research effort is the <strong>Proof
of Concept</strong> of the VTURB-GT marine hydro-kinetic power system. VTURB-GT is a vertical axis turbine tailored to low to medium velocity tidal currents (0.5m/s-2.5m/s) in the shallow estuaries of the south eastern USA. The relatively low water depths, flow reversal, constantly changing flow speed as well as the boundary layer specifics of the south eastern estuaries will be factored in the design of the hydrofoils of the turbine and the electric generator. Further objectives are the provision of details of the material to be used and material and fabrication cost estimates. We will further perform a detailed systems engineering analysis. Specific outcomes from this effort will include the finalized material specification, fabrication cost estimates and an ecological footprint assessment and mitigation strategy.</p>

<p>The proposed research activities intend to advance the engineering and design of a vertical axis turbine mock-up model for low velocity tidal currents to a laboratory scale prototype. We will provide solutions to each of the three following components of the turbine:</p>

<h5>Hydrodynamics</h5>

<p>The hydrodynamics of the existing mock-up model will be improved through complementary laboratory and numerical investigations. The design of the small scale model will be tailored to typically prevailing flow conditions in the estuaries of the South East of the US. Improvements will be done by optimization of different geometrical parameters (hydrofoil size, hydrofoil shape, hydrofoil pitch-angle) in a controlled laboratory environment; the mock-up model that performs best in these parameter studies will then be analyzed further through full three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations. The simulations will provide a detailed fluid mechanical understanding of the performance of the hydrofoils and will guide future design improvements.
</p>

<h5>Generator Design</h5>

<p>A special permanent magnet three-phase generator (for which cogging torque is equally small in both directions of rotation) will be designed to have optimal weight/mass/torque matched with available shaft speed. A challenge will be to have a water tight package of generator and power electronics.</p>

<h5>Power Electronics</h5>

<p>The output power from the generator will be controlled by specially designed power electronics and a maximum power point tracker (MPTT) in order to extract the maximum power from the turbine for any given water flow velocity and reversal of direction.</p>

<p>Near the end of the funding period a complete system of a 1:20 scale vertical axis turbine will be ready for testing. These tests will allow the proof of concept and will provide data for the range of ambient velocities as measured and simulated in a tidal channel near the city of Savannah, Georgia. For each ambient velocity tested a power characteristic curve will be attained, which provides the corresponding peak power densities.</p>

<h4>Scientific/Technical Approach</h4>

<h5>Tidal Energy Potential of the south eastern US coast</h5>

<p>The south eastern US coast provides natural water resources for clean and renewable source of sustainable energy from tidal streams. Tidal streams are strong sea currents due to the periodic motion of the tides and are often magnified by local topographical features such as headlands, inlets to inland lagoons, and straits, creating large concentrations of hydrokinetic energy. One of the big advantages of tidal streams is that they are accurately predictable; furthermore the high density of salt water implies that the energy potential of tidal streams is much higher than the potential of continental or offshore winds. Coastal tidal stream currents can have significant spatial and temporal variability. Recent research identified such locations using a state-of-the-art numerical model for simulating the tidal flows along the coast of Georgia (Defne et al., 2008, Defne, 2010). Figure 1 shows the results of such simulations for the Savannah River, Wassaw Sound and Ossabaw Sound in Georgia. In the case of the Ogeechee River within Ossabaw Sound and the Savannah River inlet, the results indicate concentrations of peak tidal stream potential power per unit area within the range of 2 - 7 kW/m<sup>2</sup>For example, a channel 50 m wide and 5 m deep with 4 kW/m<sup>2</sup> of potential power, may produce a total of 1 MW of power!</p>

<h5>Hydrokinetic Technologies for Tidal Streams</h5>

<p>There are already a number of different concepts for extracting energy from tidal streams (a good summary is found in Hardisty, 2009). These can be divided into: a) horizontal axis turbines; b) vertical axis turbines and c) other concepts e.g. based on vortex shedding (e.g. Bernitsas et al., 2006a, 2006b). Horizontal axis free-stream turbines are designed with three or more rotating blades that are driving a horizontal-axis generator in order to convert the kinetic energy of tidal and river currents into electricity. Both, horizontal axis as well as vertical axis free-stream turbines function like wind turbines and cannot use the entire kinetic energy potential of the stream, because the fluid must maintain a certain amount of momentum to leave the turbine. Further, a certain flow velocity threshold is required to economically produce power as power output is a function of the velocity cubed; the power density per (swept) unit area is P= ½  (u
    <sup>3</sup>) in which  is the density of water. On the other hand, as flow velocities increase, hydrodynamic forces (due to the high density of salt water and the intermittency of turbulence) on the turbine blades increase too, straining the relatively thin blades of horizontal axis turbines. Moreover, large free stream turbines require a certain water depth, but most tidal streams in the South East are in relatively shallow waters. Despite all that, the biggest challenge in harnessing energy from tidal streams using free-stream turbines is the oscillatory motion of the flow in tidal streams, i.e. constantly changing flow direction and considerable time periods of low flow velocity during which horizontal axis free-stream turbine may not operate efficiently. This makes turbine optimization extremely complicated and requires the design of symmetrical blades. As a direct consequence, typical free-stream turbine systems seldom operate at peak efficiency.</p>

<h5>Synergistic Research: Field Work and High Resolution Numerical Simulations on Rhose Dhu Island near the city of Savannah, Georgia (Funded through the Georgia Natural Resources – Coastal Incentive Grant)</h5>

<p>This research project of the two co-PIs (Drs. Stoesser and Fedele) is funded by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The overarching goal of this project is the quantification and eventually exploitation of the available hydropower in a select region of Rhose Dhu island (circle in Figure 1). Though fairly good estimates of mean tidal currents are available from numerical models, it is argued that local channel bathymetry, vegetated banks and boundary layer characteristics result in hotspots of hydrokinetic energy. To find and fluid mechanically characterize these hotspots the PIs will undertake both field work and state of the art numerical simulations. The project tasks relevant to this proposal are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Obtain detailed bathymetric data at selected locations around Rhose Dhu Island.</li>
    <li>Identify localized hot spots of high hydrokinetic energy in the tidal channels around Rhose Due Island through ADCP boat measurements.</li>
    <li>Quantify in great detail flow currents, turbulence structures and their statistics through high resolution numerical simulations.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result will be detailed information about locally prevailing three-dimensional velocity distributions over a typical tidal cycle. The work plan includes: identification of specific locations with highly concentrated tidal energy potential using short term boat-based measurement of the currents and bathymetry over a large area. This will require measurements during both peak flood and ebb tides to identify the locations with the largest tidal currents. Once a particular location is identified, then a state of the art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code will simulate the flows over several tidal cycles, which allows for quantifying its available tidal kinetic energy. The measurements will serve as validation data. The final outcomes of the project are detailed maps of the hot high tidal energy spots and detailed three-dimensional flow and turbulence characteristics.</p>

<p>The field work will start in 09/2010 and will provide unprecedented data for tidal stream turbine development. The bathymetry of the tidal channels around Rhose Dhu Island, the marshland bounding those channels and in particular the tidal currents are believed to be representative of the coasts of the south eastern US. The design of the proposed turbine will be tailored to the specific flow conditions prevailing in these channels rather than assuming constant and undisturbed approach velocity.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-48c9d795.png" id="750" media_type="image"]

<p>The red box outlines the area of interest. The field work includes collection of high resolution bathymetric data and detailed multidimensional velocity measurements to identify hydrokinetic energy hotspots. The field work will be complemented by sophisticated three-dimensional numerical simulations.
    </span>
    <br>
</p>

<p>Furthermore, both, the Rhose Dhu Island project and the turbine development of this proposal, have the long term synergistic goal of deployment and field testing at the identified location. <em>The Rhose Dhu Island project is not
eligible for matching funds because the funds originally come from federal
sources (NOAA)</em>
</p>

<h5>Preliminary Design – Mock-up Model</h5>

<p>The team has designed a vertical axis mock-up turbine model of VTURB-GT, which has already undergone experimental testing in the hydraulic lab of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The turbine blades are designed based on a high lift to drag ratio airfoil. The importance of this ratio is reasoned by the fact that the turbine is accelerated to a maximum rotational speed due to the acting lift forces and low drag is important due to the relatively low tip speed velocities and the viscosity of the water (as compared to a very high Re aircraft). Therefore, the NACA 66-415 airfoil was selected as for the preliminary tests.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-m714528c5.png" id="754" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-m15bfb51d.png" id="752" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-2691c86.jpg" id="748" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-4d226021.jpg" id="745" media_type="image"]
<p>The laboratory experiments were carried out to obtain the rotational speed of the turbine for three different ambient flow conditions. A second series of tests was then conducted to investigate the effect of hydrofoil pitch angle on the rotational speed. The third set of experiments was carried to investigate the effect of the number of hydrofoils. The turbine was operated at minimal resisting torque, which unambiguously allowed for the assessment of the hydrodynamic performance of the turbine hydrofoils at each ambient flow condition and for each of the different pitch angles investigated. Table 1 gives an overview of the different experiments and the obtained rotational speeds.

<p>Figure 6 presents a characteristic data set measured for one of tested configurations. It is obvious that the rotational speed is a function of both ambient velocity and pitch angle of the blade. The performance of the mock-up model is very encouraging, showing that even for velocities below 1m/s relatively high rotational speeds were obtained.</p>

[koken_photo label="Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-32100-PM.png" id="768" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>The output in terms of power density (kW/m<sup>3</sup>) was further estimated by calculating the drag force on the blade at varying rotational speed. In order to calculate the drag force the drag coefficient was determined from a 3-dimensional high resolution Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). The LES was carried out in an Eulerian framework, i.e. with the blade being fixed and cyclic boundary conditions. The background velocity (i.e. the tip speed velocity) and Re number were chosen according to the results of the experiments. Figure 7 shows instantaneous streamlines together with the distribution of the instantaneous pressure around the hydrofoil.</span>
</p>

[koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-m601d2eea.png" id="753" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>From the time-averaged pressure distribution on the hydrofoil the drag coefficient of the hydrofoil was calculated with:
</p>\[F_d=\frac{1}{2}\rho\nu^{2}C_DA\]

<p>in which \(\rho\) is the density of water, \(\nu\) the tip speed velocity, \(C_D\) the drag coefficient and \(A\) the projected area perpendicular to the flow. The force on each blade can be calculated explicitly. Knowledge of the drag coefficient allows for the direct calculation of the torque and with prescribed rotational speed the power density can be calculated from:
</p>\[P=n'\cdot r\cdot F_D\cdot \omega\]

<p>in which \(n’\) is the number of blades, \(r\) is the radius between shaft center line and blade, \(F_D\) is the drag force and \(\omega\) is the rotational speed.</p>

<p>Figure 8 presents the power density as a function of rotational speed for the four bladed turbine at a pitch angle of 10 degrees for the three different ambient flows investigated.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-24fe5bf059d4fc54-html-m107be5be.gif" id="743" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>The result in Fig. 8 is significant, particularly so that these curves were obtained for very low velocities and a turbine that is not yet optimized. It shows that the power density is a function of ambient velocity and these numbers suggest that the power density is very likely to be increasing at increasing ambient flows. It also clearly shows that for each ambient flow velocity, there is a particular rotational speed (<i>optimum speed</i>) of the turbine where maximum power can be extracted, indicated by points A, B and C in the diagram. For a family of curves like those in Fig.8, the points ABC can be joined to form a locus. Any electrical generator connected to this shaft should therefore be designed with its controller to keep the shaft speed along this locus as the ambient flow velocity. This is called <i>maximum power point
tracking</i> (MPPT).</p>

<p>Table 2 compares the potential power at 0.52m/s of VTURB-GT with other well established MHK turbines. Reasonable estimates of the efficiency of the generator (94%) the power electronics (96%) and the anticipated gearbox (90%) give a total efficiency from turbine shaft to electrical output as 0.90 x 0.94 x 0.96 = 0.81. Preliminary tests in the GT laboratory flume suggest that the system proposed may reach efficiencies around 50% (Note: the blockage effect of the turbine in the flume has been taken into account, resulting in 1.14m/s flow). Under the assumption that an upscaled version (here a 1m diameter and 3m long version of VTURB-GT) maintains its hydraulic efficiency, it compares very well with similar devices that are operated at much higher ambient velocities. Given the fact that VTURB-GT is not yet fully optimized and that most of the calculations are only theoretical, these preliminary tests suggest very encouraging numbers.</p>

<p>The numbers obtained from these tests also underline the enormous kinetic energy potential of moving (salt) water currents. For instance, GE’s 4.0 MW Offshore Wind Turbine, the 4.0-11 has a rotor diameter of 110m (i.e. a swept area of 9567m<sup>2</sup>) and a capacity of 4.0 MW, which gives an energy density of 0.42kW/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h5>Preliminary Research and Development Pathway for VTURB-GT</h5>

<p>The team has developed a preliminary R&amp;D pathway until field deployment, which is given in Table 3. The key issues to be investigated in this phase (Phase A) will be listed in detail below, however the goal is to reach the “proof of concept” stage, i.e. a 1:10 scale model that is at technology readiness level 4. For the next phase of funding (Phase B), to be pursued independent of the funding source, we will develop and test a 1:3 scale model, which will include a fully functional generator that features the necessary power electronics. This model will be tested in a larger flume in the
    <em>Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory of the Zachry department of Civil
Engineering</em> at Texas A&amp;M (see letter of collaboration from Dr. Scott Socolofsky). The tests at bigger scale will provide all the necessary data to determine the system’s performance and will confirm the power estimates to be made within this work. In the third phase of the development of VTURB-GT we will assemble and deploy the new turbine at one or multiple sites on Rhose Dhu Island, i.e. for which we will have carried out detailed measurements and numerical simulations. Rhose Dhu island is privately owned land by the Girl Scouts of Georgia who will support and assist in field testing and turbine deployment (see letter of support by Kathleen Cullinan).</p>

<p>The R&amp;D of the turbine is a four year effort (12 months + 2 x 18 months) at the end of which we will have a complete and fully operational system. The turbine will be put to operation immediately after successfully passing all the tests and will provide power for the Girl Scout camp on Rhose Dhu Island. This will also serve as a pilot experiment. Furthermore, fabrication costs, potential maintenance costs and the power output over a year will provide excellent data for a <i></i><em>Cost</em> <i></i>Benefit <em>Analysis</em>
</p>

<h5>Environmental Impact</h5>

<p>Environmental impact will be investigated and studied in a separate project (see B 1.3). The PI, Stoesser, has discussions and data exchange with Dr. Vincent Neary, from the Energy-Water-Ecosystems Engineering and Wind and Water Power Technologies group of the Environmental Science Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These discussions will lead to an active interaction on the Rose Dhu project. In general free-stream turbine concepts have the great advantage of having very low impact:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Effect on flow and sediment transport. The turbine can be limited to a scale at which its effect on natural processes is minor. It would be counter-productive to try to use the entire width of a tidal stream as this would reduce the overall energy capture and deliver diminishing returns.</li>
    <li>Threat of impact on marine wild-life from turbine blades: the speed of underwater turbine rotors is very low compared with wind turbines or with a ship or a boat propeller, and therefore they are unlikely to be a serious threat to marine wild-life. Underwater noise is also likely to be low due to the low speed of operation.</li>
    <li>Conflicts with human users of the tidal channel: the technology will be deployed in local hot spots of high velocity which tend to be dangerous for navigation and hence are generally avoided for commercial ship traffic and fishing;</li>
    <li>Lubricating oil or other potential pollutants are present in very small quantities and are so well contained they are most unlikely to escape. There is no other potential pollutant;</li>
</ul>


<h5>Key Issues to be Investigated within this Phase</h5>

<p>The key research issues to be investigated in this phase of the development of VTURB-GT can be broadly divided into civil engineering and electro-mechanical engineering groups.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CE.1</strong> The hydrodynamics of the hydrofoils/blades requires thorough investigation. In the past, Darrieus type vertical axis (water) turbines have utilized hydrofoils that are neither optimized for low Reynolds number flow nor for their performance to operate in the wake of the preceding hydrofoil. The dimensions and the shape of the hydrofoils for the proposed four-spoke vertical axis turbine need to be chosen such that each hydrofoil makes use of the low drag in the slipstream of the preceding hydrofoil but at the same time produces maximum lift to accelerate the turbine to a predesigned tip speed at which maximum power extraction can be achieved.</li>
    <li><strong>CE.2</strong> The velocity profile characteristics of a typical south-eastern US tidal channel have to be taken into account for the design of the turbine hydrofoils. This can be done by varying the pitch angle from top to bottom. The optimum pitch angle and its distribution over the water depth need to be known.</li>
    <li><strong>CE.3</strong> For the maximum extraction of power from the stream, a turbine characteristics curve, which plots generator speed in rpm (or tip speed in m/s) versus power extraction like Fig. 8, needs to be developed for a characteristic tidal cycle that includes the whole range of approach velocities.</li>
    <li><strong>CE.4</strong> Tidal stream currents reach their peak velocity only once every few hours, which requires the turbine to be optimized for low velocities, so that it allows for efficient power extraction during peak flow, late lock-out before mid-tide and early lock-in after mid-tide.</li>
    <li><strong>ECE.1</strong> The permanent magnet electric generator will have a shaft that rotates at varying speeds for a while and then reverses. Maximum speed will be relatively low unless a gearbox is added. Equations will have to be developed to establish design rules for numbers of stator slots and turns per slot, choice of magnet shapes and geometries to minimize cogging torque for both directions of direction. The inertia of the rotor will be determined from a study of the dynamics in shaft speed. The rest of the machine design will then be optimized, possibly using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) from that starting point, and the maximum power and speed point A in Fig. 8. This process is intrinsically linked to ME.1 below.</li>
    <li><strong>ECE.2</strong> The output power from the generator will have to be controlled by power electronics in order to ensure maximum power point tracking (illustrated in Fig. 8) without stalling the entire motion. This will have to happen continuously in time to match the power available from the hydrodynamic motion that continuously changes speed.</li>
    <li><strong>ME.1</strong> Design and build the mechanical support structure for the tests in the flume in Fig. 9.</li>
    <li><strong>ME2.</strong> Building on ECE.2 a detailed mechanical optimization of the rotor structure for maximum strength and fatigue life to satisfy a required inertia, is required. In addition a decision will have to made about a gearbox and all its implications on weight/volume/efficiency. High speeds are preferable for the generator as its volume decreases directly as speed increases. This optimization process is not suited to analytical solution and therefore evolutionary or PSO techniques could be pursued.</li>
    <li><strong>ME.3</strong> For an underwater generator the motor losses could be cooled much more efficiently than in air, and higher losses could thus be tolerated leading to a more compact design. Cooling could be from water flowing over the outside surface of the generator, or even passing thru water tubes inside the generator. The trade-off between reduction in volume and weight of the generator and the thermal management will need investigation and included in the optimization procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>ME.4</strong> If the underwater generator is to be totally enclosed and water proof then the shaft seals at both ends of the generator will have to be water proof and withstand the corrosive environment of sea water.</li>
    <li><strong>ME.5</strong> All the materials of the VTURB-GT including the outside of the generator will have to withstand the corrosive environment of sea water.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Research and Development Methods</h5>

<h6>Laboratory experiments (CE.1 to CE.4)</h6>

<p>A number of different laboratory experiments are proposed Experiments will be carried out in a 3.3ft wide, 3 ft deep, 30ft long flume in the hydraulics laboratory in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Tech. A 20ft long inlet region will be artificially roughened to ensure a developed fully-rough turbulent boundary layer that reproduces a typical velocity profile as measured on Rhose Dhu Island. The region downstream of the turbine will be used to eliminate effects of the tailgate in establishing uniform flow. The flume is constructed at a fixed slope such that uniform flow can be established for different flow rates by adjusting the tailgate to accommodate the changing hydraulic roughness with depth. A high resolution, high speed camera will be mounted above the turbine, and image processing and computer vision algorithms for visual tracking will be employed to detect the hydrofoil motion from live video images. This will allow visualization and characterization of the flow around the turbine and will provide valuable insight into fluid structure interaction. In the flume tests the turbine shaft could be loaded by a flat belt friction load as illustrated in Fig. 9 in order to produce curves like those in Fig. 8 and validate theoretical designs. Adjustment of the wing nut will regulate the amount of load torque applied by the belt to the shaft and the spring balance will indicate force directly, from which torque can be calculated.</p>

<h6>Large-Eddy Simulations (CE.1)</h6>

<p>The method of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) will be employed to simulate the flow around several selected hydrofoil arrangements providing a detailed fluid mechanical understanding of the system. The PI Stoesser has already applied LES for similar fluid structure interaction problems including the flow around single cylinders or two-cylinders-in-tandem Palau-Salvador et al. (2008, 2009). The accuracy of LES is well established and seems very well suitable for such problems. For instance Jimenez have employed the technique of LES for the detailed analysis of the flow in a wind turbine wake. In a recent review paper on “Large Eddy Simulations of the Flow past Bluff Bodies” (Rodi, 2001) it was concluded: “<i>The flow past bluff bodies can be well predicted by LES …
basically all the complex features of the 3D flow are simulated well by LES,
even quantitatively, and the results are much better than those of RANS
calculations…</i>”. The simulations will be performed with the code HYDRO3D-GT. This is a successor of the code HYDRO3D originally developed at Bristol, University (Stoesser, 2002). The code solves equations the filtered Navier Stokes equations on Cartesian grids using a cell-centered finite-volume method with collocated storage of the Cartesian velocity components. Second-order central differences are employed for the convective as well as for the diffusive terms. A fractional-step method is used with a Runge-Kutta predictor and the solution of a pressure-correction equation in the final step as a corrector. Sub-grid stresses that appear as a result of the filtering operation are modeled using the dynamic Smagorinsky model (Germano, 1990). A fluid structure interaction module is implemented that uses the immersed boundary (IB) method to enforce the no-slip condition on the bluff body and on the plate of the wing. By using the IB method, the entire simulation can be carried out on a Cartesian grid that does not conform to the geometry of the bluff body and the wing. LES enables detailed and accurate quantification of fluid forces acting on the hydrofoils. The simulations will be carried out on a high performance supercomputer at sufficient resolution to obtain highly accurate results.
</p>

<h6>Electromechanical Design (ECE 1-3, ME 1-4)</h6>

<p>The basic methodology will develop reduced order physics-based models that characterize the performance of initial electromechanical machine designs. These models have medium fidelity but enable a rapid reduction of the design domain to identify design regions and possible candidate solutions for detailed analysis using finite element techniques. 2D and 3D electromagnetic software may be utilized to analyze and evaluate design trade-offs for a baseline generator. Results from these evaluations will be used in Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. A similar approach will be followed in the thermo-mechanical analysis, wherein Finite Element Techniques will be used to analyze the heat flow and structural strengths of the generator.</p>

<h5>Research Tasks</h5>

<p>The research tasks can be broadly divided into civil engineering (CE) tasks and electro-mechanical (ECE/ME) tasks.</p>

<h6>Fluid Mechanical (CE)</h6>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Design and build a modular small-sale prototype without generator which allows for laboratory testing. Testing of different hydrofoil designs as well as different geometrical parameters will be performed.</li>
    <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Carry out high resolution large-eddy simulations of selected laboratory tests. Acquire high-resolution velocity and pressure data and analyze the performance of the three best performing hydrofoil designs.</li>
    <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Using the test rig depicted in Figure 9, power characteristic curves for three full tidal cycles, one neap, one spring and one average tidal cycle will be attained. As velocity changes in a tidal cycle are relatively small, the full cycles will be mimicked by an extensive series of quasi steady ambient flow conditions. The corresponding discharges and water depths will match the ones measured simulated and measured in the field.</li>
</ul>

    <li><strong>Task 14:</strong> Document generation including final report. .</li>
</ul>


<h4>Potential Market Impact</h4>

<p><i>This cannot be estimated at this early stage, due to the not yet
completed cost analysis. However</i> the ERoEI (Energy Return on Energy Invested) for a tailored o specific ambient flow conditions tidal turbine can be predicted to be higher than for most energy technologies. For instance the ERoEI for wind turbines has been found to be between 4 and 6 months (depending on the wind regime and the technology, Danish Windpower, 1997). The material and the power density of tidal turbines are similar to those parameters for wind turbines, hence the ERoEI seems likely to be of the same order. Tidal turbines are expected to have operational life of ≥20 (Hardisty, 2009) and an energy payback of around 6 months (which is to be expected in VTURB-GT) represents an excellent investment in terms of energy payback likely delivering 40× the energy needed to build, install and operate it.</p>

<h2>Relevance and Outcomes/Impacts</h2>

<p>Renewable clean energy is important for the US, and this project seeks to optimize energy harvested using free flowing water in rivers and the tidal streams. This will contribute to the US efforts to reduce carbon-dioxide output and dependency on foreign fossil fuel. In particular, the coasts of the South and South East has abundant natural tidal streams for a clean and renewable source of sustainable energy. This work has potential for a tremendous impact on the energy sustainability of Georgia and other states with strong tidal stream currents. Once we understand how to extract power from tidal stream currents, we may begin to think in more grandiose terms of how to tap into the enormous amount of energy contained in massive ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream using related approaches. Other potential sources are rivers for which free stream turbines such as VTURB-GT will be a very cost effective alternative to hydropower plants. This could have a major impact on both national and international level in terms of clean energy potential.</p>

<h2>CFD Analysis</h2>

<p>A vertical axis turbine is developed in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and has undergone laboratory testing. The complex flow pattern around the turbine needs to be studied in order to optimize the turbine’s hydrofoil. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools are used to simulate the fluid flow through the vertical axis turbine. For this independent research, commercial code packages are used to facilitate the CFD simulation. ICEM CFD is used as a primary meshing tool and Fluent V12 is used in combination with ANSYS Workbench as a 2-D unstructured grid solver. The problem is solved using moving reference frame domains. The rotating reference frame encompasses four NACA 66-415 hydrofoils. Inlet velocity boundary condition is applied to account for incoming flow and the outlet is characterized as a pressure-outlet with 0 gauge pressure, essentially simulating far-field pressure. Top and bottom walls are fixed with no-slip conditions. The results are demonstrated by plotting velocity and pressure contours.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Invention of the modern computer has allowed for tremendous computational simulations of real world engineering problems. Numerical methods have increasingly become powerful in simulating interactions and behavior of complex engineering problems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that employs numerical methods to analyze and predict fluid flows. The computational power of modern day computers has facilitated complex scenarios involving turbulent, transient, mixing and even supersonic flows.</p>

<p>In order to accurately simulate flow through a vertical axis turbine, a crude initial methodology for meshing and problem set-up is developed. For simulations involving moving parts such as impellers, fans, blades, hubs, shaft surfaces, etc. are prescribed as rotating at a given angular velocity. The stationary walls are generally surfaces of revolution, however, this need not always be the case. Immobilization of the rotating coordinate system cannot be sufficiently achieved without multiple reference frames for convergence to a steady-state flow field. Therefore, a single rotating reference frame is not applicable to simulations entailing a vertical axis turbine where stationary surfaces are not surfaces or revolution.</p>

<p>Thus, by employing moving (non-inertial) reference frames the resultant simulation is a snap-shot in time of a transient flow field within which the rotating parts are moving. If the interface between the inertial and non-inertial frame is chosen such that there is no angular dependence (such as a revolved interface or radially symmetric moving zone), a time-averaged flow field can be reliably determined. This method has played a crucial role in turbo-machinery industry where time-averaged fluid flow through rotating parts is of importance.</p>

<h3>Moving Reference Frame - Theory</h3>

<p>A key advantage of using a rotating reference frame is to render a problem that is unsteady in a stationary frame with respect to the moving reference frame. If the rotational speed is constant, by transforming the equations of fluid motion to the rotating reference frame, steady-state solution can be found.
</p>

<p>Assume that in the stationary coordinate system, a vector \(\overrightarrow{r_{0}}\)points at the origin of the rotating frame. The rotating frame has an angular velocity \(\overrightarrow{\omega}\). Thus, the fluid velocities can be transformed from the stationary frame to the rotating frame using the following equations.</p>\[\overrightarrow{v_{r}} = \overrightarrow{v}- \left(\overrightarrow{\omega}\times\overrightarrow{r}\right)\]

<p>Where \(\overrightarrow{v_r}\) is the relative velocity as viewed from the rotating frame, \(\overrightarrow{v}\)is the absolute velocity viewed from the stationary frame. Thus, by velocity formulation using the aforementioned relation, the corresponding conservation of mass, momentum and energy equations can be determined as follows.</p>

<h5>Conservation of mass:</h5>\[\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\triangledown\cdot\rho\overrightarrow{v_r}=0\]

<h5>Conservation of momentum:</h5>\[\frac{\partial }{\partial t}(\rho\overrightarrow{v_r})+\triangledown\cdot(\rho\overrightarrow{v_r}\overrightarrow{v_r})+\rho(2\overrightarrow{\omega}\times\overrightarrow{v_r}+\overrightarrow{\omega}\times\overrightarrow{\omega}\times\overrightarrow{r})=-\triangledown p+\triangledown\cdot\overline{\overline{\tau_r}} +\overrightarrow{F}\]

<h5>Conservation of Energy:</h5>\[\frac{\partial }{\partial t}(\rho E_r)+\triangledown\cdot(\rho\overrightarrow{v_r}\overrightarrow{H_r})=-\triangledown\cdot(k\triangledown T+\overline{\overline{\tau_r}}\cdot \overrightarrow{v_r})+S_h\]

<p>The above formulations for rotating reference frame are used in ANSYS Fluent v12. Although ANSYS Fluent code is mature and tremendously extensive, the fundamental principle of CFD is rather simple. Essentially the aforementioned equations are discretized both spatially and temporally, and applied to the mesh to solve for the required quantities. Due to the increasing complexity of meshing as well as computational demands, the simulations in this research project are limited to multiple reference frames. Advanced methods such as sliding and deforming meshes are beneficial and can yield accurate results for simulating rotating parts, given time and computational resources. These methods are inherently unsteady due to the motion of mesh with time.</p>

<p>To implement the multiple reference frame model, it is necessary to subdivide the problem domain into stationary and rotating sub-domains. For a vertical axis turbine, the three sub-domains are as follows. Since the airfoils are rotating about the vertical axis, the rotating sub-domain is ring shaped cell zone. The four hydrofoils are contained within this rotating fluid sub-domain. The central core is stationary fluid. Similarly, the outer region is stationary and not a surface of revolution (rectangular). These regions are labeled in Figure 10. Regions 1 and 3 are stationary whilst region 2 is rotating.
</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-2a48acd1.png" id="755" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>The multiple reference frame model requires the two interfaces (X and Y in Figure 10.) to be represented as “interior zones” in fluid. This indicates the solver that all the rotational velocities (computed in the rotating reference frame) are required to be converted to absolute frame and applied to the interfaces along with local scalars.</p>

<h3>geometry and mesh</h3>

<h4>Airfoil Geometry</h4>

<p>For this research project, a standard airfoil namely NACA 66-415 is used. There are numerous methodologies for meshing airfoils depending on the application. NACA airfoils typically come in ASCII text file which is specially formatted for input in ICEM CFD. The curves are automatically created in ICEM CFD. For a 2-D planer study, it is easier to use an ASCII text file as an input and the problem geometry is simple enough to be constructed in the meshing package, i.e. ICEM CFD.</p>

<h4>Blocking Strategy</h4>

<p>Blocking strategy is a method of abstraction used in CFD meshing to separate and organize convergence points, vertex and edge associations, segmentation, radial or rectangular orientation of the mesh. It is important to understand the overall structure of the mesh before delving deeper into detailed meshing. Blocking strategy allows for conceptualization of the mesh structure. After importing the airfoil curves, an H-grid is used to block the flow field around the airfoil. Figure 11 shows the blocking structure in the vicinity of the airfoil. Note the X and Y interfaces between the rotating reference frame and stationary reference frames discussed earlier.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-m34816a1a.png" id="766" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>Identical blocking strategy is employed for the rest of the three airfoils in the circumference. Figure 12. Illustrates overall blocking of the three reference frames. As shown in Figure 12., the central stationary zone is an orthogonal double H-grid surrounded by the moving reference frame with an O-grid that is split into 4 smaller H-grids in the vicinity of each of the airfoils. The outermost stationary reference domain is essentially a C-grid with the square end oriented towards the pressure-outlet or exhaust.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-m2d6c89de.png" id="761" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>Figure 12. Overall blocking strategy.</p>

<p>Although, there are many other ways to approach the problem as far as blocking strategy is concerned, however, tuned and refined methods come with an increasing complexity and learning curve. Therefore, the simplest and most effective methods are used in this research project. An alternative method suggested for meshing the flow field around the airfoil is to use a C-grid wrapping the leading edge, especially for periodic meshing. In the next section, this method will be briefly discussed.</p>

<h4>Periodic Meshing</h4>

<p>Conserving computational costs is often of interest if the problem domain comprises of a large number of nodes. Surfaces of revolution can be segmented into periodically repeating sections. As an example, a 120 degree section of a 4 airfoil vertical axis turbine is shown in Figure 13. The leading edge of the airfoil is wrapped by a C-grid. The squared side of the C-grid faces towards the flow outlet. To improve the sharp trailing edge mesh density, a wedge shaped block is utilized.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-4f90211c.png" id="756" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>There is an important aspect of periodic meshing that has been disregarded in the mesh illustrated in Figure 13. In order for periodicity to work, by principle, the outlet flow conditions are iteratively fed back to the inlet. Therefore, every node in the outlet edge must coincide with nodes on the inlet edge. To combat this problem, an inverted C-grid is constructed in front of the leading edge. The final mesh is depicted in Figure 14 below.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-m7f259282.png" id="763" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>In addition to periodic meshing, inflation and gradient mesh density can also serve in conserving computational costs.</p>

<h3>Boundary Conditions</h3>

<p>The results from a CFD simulation largely depend upon the problem set-up and it is extremely important to apply the correct boundary conditions in accord with the real physical system. The problem consists of roughly 8 meter diameter rotor with a 16 meter channel width. This problem set-up can easily be scaled up or down depending on the user’s choice. The incompressible fluid of interest is water with a density of 998.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and viscosity of 1.003x10
    <sup>-3</sup> kg/m-s.</p>

<p>The top and bottom walls and airfoil surfaces are modeled as no-slip wall boundaries. The inlet and outlet is defined as pressure-inlet and pressure-outlet respectively. Indeed, a velocity-inlet condition could be used instead with a constant inlet velocity, however, due to continuity convergence problems; pressure-inlet is better suited. The fluid cell zone surrounding the airfoils is modeled as rotating reference frame with rotational speed of 10 RPM with the (0,0) coordinates as the axis of rotation. For the airfoils to move along with the surrounding fluid, a moving reference frame model is used with zero angular velocity with respect to the surrounding fluid. With these settings, the blades will move at the same speed as the fluid cell zone surrounding it.</p>

<p>ANSYS Fluent features several viscous flow models. For this research project, a two equation k-epsilon turbulent model is used with standard wall treatment. The solution is initialized from the 1 PSI inlet boundary. The computed initial velocity at the inlet is determined to be 3.716 m/s. A parallel processing model is employed to use two CPU cores at once for rapid computation. Results are discussed in the next section.</p>

<h3>Results &amp; Discussion</h3>

<p>As shown in the following contour plots for velocity and pressure, the results agree with the expectations. Figure 15 and 7 plots the velocity contours. Multiple vortices can be clearly identified in within the turbine. The results indicate that even though the velocity throughout the outermost stationary domain is approximately 3.7 m/s, it is not sufficient enough to bypass the rotating turbine at 10 RPM angular velocity. A substantial swirling of the flow is caused alone by the rotational domain. Figure 15 shows the swirling wake induced by the turbine and it is not diffused until 25 meters downstream.
</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-6b6a1d77.png" id="757" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-m30d4b542.png" id="764" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>The turbulence in the central region of the turbine does not have any considerable influence on the top and bottom airfoils as seen in pressure contours (Figure 17 and 18).</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-56682e64.png" id="759" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-mb868c34.png" id="767" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<p>Figure 19 and 20 show the streamlines defined by flow through the turbine. Velocity is indicated by the color of a particular streamline.</p>

[koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-m7f5cb750.png" id="762" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"] [koken_photo label="i-b90bcf888ae4fcec-html-5804d407.png" id="758" media_type="image" caption="both" link="none"]

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, computational fluid dynamics is an extremely powerful tool given the user understands and accepts the limitations. It is learned that the convergence of solutions has a significant dependence on the quality of the mesh. Skewness factor of 0.5 or higher yields erroneous results in ANSYS Fluent. Blocking strategy must be chosen carefully to accommodate for the skewing of cells as well as orthogonality.</p>

<p>For this research project, the results are not only convincing but can further be used for blade configuration and optimization. Wake characteristics found from this study can be deployed to devise inter-turbine distance and distribution of a turbine farm. Advanced simulation methods such as sliding meshes and transient models can be further built upon this study.</p>
